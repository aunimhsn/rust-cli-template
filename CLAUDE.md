# CLAUDE.md

## Communication

- Always communicate with the user in French through the Claude Code harness (chat responses, explanations, questions).
- Address the user informally, with « tu » (tutoiement), never « vous », in every session.

## Naming conventions

- Follow Rust conventions: Rust source files and module directories use snake_case (e.g. `src/file_parser.rs`, `src/user_settings/`).
- All other files and directories use kebab-case (e.g. `docs/getting-started.md`, `scripts/`).
- Standard names keep their conventional form (e.g. `Cargo.toml`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`).
- File and directory names must be in English.

## Language

- Everything in the project (code, identifiers, comments, documentation, commit messages) must be written in English.
- Exception: the translations of the user interface, if the project has any. Only the translated strings and their comments are in the other language; the code stays in English.
- If the user interface is translated, its texts are never hard-coded: each message goes into the translation file of every language (English is the reference), read with the library chosen in `docs/technical-choices.md`.
- Exception: the code review notes in `outputs/` are written in French.

## Specifications and roadmap

- Before writing code, describe the expected behavior of the application in `specs.md`, then split the work into steps in `roadmap.md`, and write the technical choices and their reasons in `docs/technical-choices.md`.
- At the start of each session, read `roadmap.md` to know the progress; when asked to continue, resume at the first unchecked step.
- At the start of each step, before writing any code, judge whether splitting it into sub-steps (2a, 2b…) helps, and how finely: the split must be an advantage, never a burden, and its granularity is Claude Code's call at each step. A sub-step is one pull request with one coherent change that can be reviewed in one pass and tested on its own, without leaving the application broken in between; a small step stays whole, since each pull request also costs a review, the checks and an archive. Propose the split to the owner, then write it in `roadmap.md`.
- Each step is delivered in its own pull request, which checks the step's box in `roadmap.md`.
- Keep `roadmap.md` consistent with `specs.md` when the specifications change.
- Keep `roadmap.md` short, since it is read at every session: the steps to come in detail, one line per step done with its pull requests. When the pull request of a step (or of a sub-step) is merged, move the detail of the step to `docs/roadmap-archive.md`. Reference notes (technical choices, rules of the external services) live in `docs/`, linked from `roadmap.md`, and are read only by the steps that need them.
- Read `specs.md` by section: list its headings first (`grep -n '^#' specs.md`), then read only the sections the step needs.
- When the pull request of a step (or of a sub-step) is merged, tell the owner that the step is done and remind them to start a new session for the next step by typing `/clear` (give them the command): a fresh session costs far fewer tokens, and `roadmap.md` and the memory hold what is needed to resume.

## Connectors

- The claude.ai connectors (Claude Docs and the others) are turned off for the project in `.claude/settings.json` (`disableClaudeAiConnectors`): their instructions and tools would be sent with every message. Remove the setting only if the project needs one of them.
- The skills a project doesn't use (documents, slides, spreadsheets, browsers, charts, Claude API…) are hidden from the model in the same file (`skillOverrides`, `user-invocable-only`): their descriptions would be sent with every message. The owner can still run them with `/<name>`; to give one back to the model, remove its line or use `/skills`.

## Working folders

Two folders are the exchange area between the owner and Claude Code. They are ignored by Git, except their `.gitkeep`, and hold only temporary files.

- `inputs/`: what the owner gives for context: screenshots, examples, references, copied texts. Read them when the owner points to them; never commit, move or delete them unless asked.
- `outputs/`: what Claude Code produces for the owner: reports, code review notes, previews, screenshots. Name them `<YYYY-MM-DD>-<subject>.<ext>` when they are meant to be kept for a while.
- Anything meant to last goes elsewhere and is committed: documentation in `docs/`, images used by the application in `assets/`, test data next to the tests.

## Process

- Follow the phases of `process.md`: specifications, wireframes, mock-up, design system, then the build, one pull request per step.
- For a user interface, start with editable Excalidraw wireframes in `docs/wireframes/` (grayscale, one group per block; `excalidraw-wireframes` skill), and build the HTML mock-up only once the owner has approved the layout (`html-mockups` skill).
- During the specifications, check the documentation, rate limits and terms of use of every external service, and record its limits and the risks the owner accepts, with their date, in a note of `docs/` linked from `roadmap.md` (e.g. `docs/<service>-usage.md`).
- For the mock-up, compare 3 or 4 styles that explore new directions for this application. `design-journal.md` records the past design experiences: use it as a source of ideas for one style at most, never as default rules. Give each open decision its own tab group on the mock-up page, and remove it once decided. A new section of the mock-up goes at the top of the page, so that the owner finds it at once; past ten sections, a table of contents under the header links to each.

## Git workflow

- Never commit or push directly to `main`.
- For each task, create a dedicated branch from `main`, commit and push only on that branch.
- Every change must go through a pull request targeting `main`.
- Each time a pull request is opened or updated, give the owner its full link (`https://github.com/<owner>/<repository>/pull/<number>`), not only its number.
- Merge pull requests with **Squash and merge** only, so that each pull request becomes one commit on `main`, titled in Conventional Commits. The repository allows only squash merging and deletes the branch once merged; check these settings on every new repository (`gh repo edit --enable-squash-merge --enable-merge-commit=false --enable-rebase-merge=false --delete-branch-on-merge`).
- Name branches `<type>/<short-description>` in kebab-case, using the commit types below (e.g. `feat/dark-mode`, `fix/settings-save`).
- Never switch branches in the main project directory while the owner may be testing a branch there (for example with `cargo run`): it would change the code they run. Work on any other branch in a separate Git worktree outside the project (`git worktree add <directory> -b <branch> origin/main`), and remove it with `git worktree remove <directory>` once the work is pushed.

## Commit messages

Follow [Conventional Commits 1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). Pull request titles use the same format.

```
<type>(<optional scope>): <description>

<optional body: what and why>

<optional footer>
```

| Type | Use for |
|---|---|
| `feat` | A new feature for the user. |
| `fix` | A bug fix. |
| `docs` | Documentation only (`README.md`, `specs.md`, `roadmap.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, doc comments). |
| `style` | Formatting with no code change. |
| `refactor` | A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature. |
| `perf` | A performance improvement. |
| `test` | Adding or fixing tests only. |
| `build` | Build system or dependencies (`Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`). |
| `ci` | CI configuration (`.github/`). |
| `chore` | Other maintenance (tooling, `.gitignore`, Claude Code agents). |
| `revert` | Reverting a previous commit. |

- Scope: optional, the module or area concerned (e.g. `feat(settings): ...`, `fix(parser): ...`).
- Description: imperative mood, lowercase, no final period, 72 characters max (e.g. `feat(settings): save the settings atomically`).
- Breaking change: add `!` after the type or scope (e.g. `feat(settings)!: ...`) and explain it in a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.

## Code review

- Before opening any pull request that changes code or its build (`src/`, tests, `Cargo.toml`, `build.rs`, `rust-toolchain.toml`, `.github/workflows/`), run the `code-reviewer` subagent (`.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md`) on the branch.
- It writes its recommendations, in French, to `outputs/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<branch>-code-review.md`. These notes are ignored by Git.
- Summarize the recommendations to the user and apply only the ones they approve, then open the pull request.

## Development

- Before committing, run and make sure all of these pass:
  - `cargo fmt --all --check`
  - `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`
  - `cargo test --all-features`
- The same checks run in CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) on every pull request.
- `unsafe` code is forbidden and Clippy pedantic lints are enabled (see `[lints]` in `Cargo.toml`).
- `rust-version` in `Cargo.toml` is the minimum Rust version: CI also builds with it. Raise it when a dependency or a language feature needs a newer Rust.

## Releases

- Pushing a version tag (e.g. `v0.1.0`) that matches the version of `Cargo.toml` publishes a GitHub release with the executables for Windows, macOS and Linux (`.github/workflows/release.yml`).
- This workflow suits a command-line or terminal application. For a desktop application (installers) or a web application (deployment), adapt or replace it, and record the choice in `docs/technical-choices.md`.
